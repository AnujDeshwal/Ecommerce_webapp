topic:Simple APi call 
very important that ek hota hai apne react app just start hi kiya and api call should be happened and all products should be fetched right now no filter has been applied so api call is executed first dispatch call the action function which do some action here in case of api call it always be a thunkAsync function in react and then that thunk func would be calling the api call function then data would be fetched and get updated in the state of store using the extraReducers then in the main file like productList file we will be calling the useSelector hook so that we can access the store and inside the store we would fetch that data and display it 
topic:filter
In the filter you need to make another thunk function another api call because and in the api if you want to apply the filter so in the url of api you have to do some changes like applying a ? and then you can access the keys of the object in the json file here we used json-server
|| what is json server ?
json server is nothing but create a api for us you just need to provide a data.json file to it so that at that api call that data of data.json file would be fetched basically json server package seeks for a port no. by default it can run on 3000 port but manually port could be provided ,we use json server because it make a free api for us without the use of nodejs or backend otherwise you know how to make a api by get ,post request and also they give us functionality =>
1.like in you json file there would be key pair like category:smartphone so you can filter then like you api is this http://localhost:8080/products?category=smartphone so this helps in filter also http://localhost:8080/products?brand=apple means now that object would be fetched who has brand:apple as a key so this helps and for the filter you need to create other thunk function and another api call .
2.simple go to json server npm site and ther scroll below and there would be many functionality liike sort filter of json server
