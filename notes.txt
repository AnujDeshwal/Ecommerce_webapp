useEffect karte wakt if dispatch kar rahe ho so use dispatch in the [] also otherwise it gives warning 
topic:Simple APi call 
very important that ek hota hai apne react app just start hi kiya and api call should be happened and all products should be fetched right now no filter has been applied so api call is executed first dispatch call the action function which do some action here in case of api call it always be a thunkAsync function in react and then that thunk func would be calling the api call function then data would be fetched and get updated in the state of store using the extraReducers then in the main file like productList file we will be calling the useSelector hook so that we can access the store and inside the store we would fetch that data and display it 
topic:filter
In the filter you need to make another thunk function another api call because and in the api if you want to apply the filter so in the url of api you have to do some changes like applying a ? and then you can access the keys of the object in the json file here we used json-server
|| what is json server ?
json server is nothing but create a api for us you just need to provide a data.json file to it so that at that api call that data of data.json file would be fetched basically json server package seeks for a port no. by default it can run on 3000 port but manually port could be provided ,we use json server because it make a free api for us without the use of nodejs or backend otherwise you know how to make a api by get ,post request and also they give us functionality =>
1.like in you json file there would be key pair like category:smartphone so you can filter then like you api is this http://localhost:8080/products?category=smartphone so this helps in filter also http://localhost:8080/products?brand=apple means now that object would be fetched who has brand:apple as a key so this helps and for the filter you need to create other thunk function and another api call .
2.simple go to json server npm site and ther scroll below and there would be many functionality liike sort filter of json server 
3.it also limit the product get fetched during api call just put this ?_limit=10 so only 10 products would be seen so this concept could be used in the pagination 
topic:Pagination functionality
now hear me out that you limit your products from the api by ?_page=2&_limit=10 means first page would have 1 to 10 then second page would haev 11 to 20 this is done by json-server package later on we will build our own backend which will provide the same functionality whatever right now json server is giving to us and now you are limiting the product but json-server know that total product is 100 no filter has been applied right now so when you apply a filter like brand=apple so now total result would not 100 it will less than it it is not a limit out of 100 products where totalItems count would remain same but in the brand filter totalItems will be according to they brand so let say only two results come now the problem is we are at the page 9 so it should be suppposed to happen that when i will apply filter on any page so then it should redirect me to page1 becasue here we have only 2 results so these will come in the first page only because ITEMS_PER_PAGE is 10 and results is 2 so then we use useEffect that as soon as totalItems from the server will be changed jo api se mil raha hai so page 1 mai la aana and here you have also something showint 1 to 100 out of 100 results so is me ye check karna that if ITEMS_PER_PAGE is greater then totalItems so then apko formula mai change karna hoga go to pagination in product list there is that forumula 
topic:very hot topic about react why i was getting error and useEffect did not invoke
see useEffect always run after the component get rendered means if you are updating something in the useEffect dekho you have productDetails now shuruwaat mai maine use esa kara details:{} i set an empty object now what happend that that detail would be updated my api so in the useEffect i was calling the thunk function to call api so that details would get updated fro {} to some details in that object but useEffect toh hamesa component render ke baat chalta hai and in my component there was like details.title and so on now it is an empty object it also had details.images[0] now it was giving the error or reding 0 means kuch undefined hai like {} and uske andr 0 index ko accessa kar rahe ho so now useEffect isliye nahi chalra that renderr hote hue hi error aa ja raha toh useEffect toh uske baat chalta hai so vo chal hi nahi raha so very important step that aap check kar sakte ho if details is empty so uske component mai kuch hona hi nahi chahiye ya component ko then render mat karo sabse aasaan ki details ko null se initialise karo then do this 
return (
    {details && <div> </div>} means simple details null hai toh and operator aage nahi jaane dega and means component toh render ho gaya bas kuch tha nahi uske andr kuki render waali cheej mai toh && ke aage gaya hi nahi na or component without error renderr ho jayega and useEffect call ho jayega then details mai api se value aa jayegi null nahi rahega so && ke aage ka bhi render hoga

topic:productdetails page fetch karne ke tarike 
here we did like first hamne detail page ko fetch karaya ki jese hi product mai click ho so NavLink se 
detail-page/${product.id} id bhi bheji now i sent id too because i will fetch id from useParams and then through that id i can call api   , our api suppor /id this functionality , in the route if you want to declare variable ki koi variable cheej aayegi so we do like this detail-page/:id now i am like jese hi click karega toh id params me jayegi mai useParams se fetch karunga and then jese hi params mai change aayega mera useEffect invoke ho jayega ku ki mai iski [] isme params.id daal dunga na then fetch kar lunga hum direct bhi kar sakte the that onClick mai hi id bhejdo dispatch mai useEffect ka use nahi hota 
topic:error
just got invalid hook call , const dispatch = useDispatch; karna ye that useDispatch()
topic: get components from tailwind
when you take a component from the taiwind so it generally in the format of html but in the react we need jsx format so remember to convert html to jsx
